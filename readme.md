This project allows a user to load Shapefiles and DBFs into the browser with JavaScript.
Outputs as [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) for use with other Mapping APIs such as [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org).

Inspired by the excellent work by Tom Carden ([http://github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js/](http://github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js/)).
